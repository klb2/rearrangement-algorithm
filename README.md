# Rearrangement Algorithm

The implementation is based on the R library
[qrmtools](https://cran.r-project.org/package=qrmtools) (version 0.0-13), which
is also licensed under GPLv3.

Details on the algorithm and the R implementation can be found in the paper
["Implementing the Rearrangement Algorithm: An Example from Computational Risk
Management", M. Hofert, In: Risks, vol. 8, no. 2,
2020](https://doi.org/10.3390/risks8020047).
